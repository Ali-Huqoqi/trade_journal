[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.x-blue)](https://www.python.org/)

## Overview

This project analyses my trading journal data collected during my funded challenge with an online prop firm, which I successfully passed.  
It computes performance metrics and visualises key insights such as cumulative profit/loss, monthly performance, best performing days, and most profitable currency pairs.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-Huqoqi/trade_journal.git
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. Add your `Trades.csv` file to the project folder.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python trade_journal.py
   ```
